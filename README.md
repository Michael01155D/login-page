Personal project to create a reusable login/logout page using MERN stack to learn basics on user authentication/authorization. 

Current TODOs (more will likely be added):

-Implement Authorization (currently it only checks if jwt is included in login response from server)

-Create a registration/sign up form that adds a User to the db (include proper validation)

-improve visual design of webpage

- add session management (so user stays logged in on page refresh -- this is likely tied to first todo)
